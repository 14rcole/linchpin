Before investigating the main components of LinchPin -- provisioning, topologies, hooks, layouts, etc.-- you'll learn how to get LinchPin installed and cover some basic concepts. We'll also cover how to use the ``linchpin`` command line interface, some configuration basics, and of course the provisioning providers.

If you are looking to get started right away, checkout the :doc:`getting_started` guide.
